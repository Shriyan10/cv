# Portfolio Redesign: Blueprint Noir

Goal: Transform the generic portfolio into a high-end, professional "alive" experience.

## 🎨 DESIGN COMMITMENT
- **Style Name**: Blueprint Noir
- **Topological Choice**: Asymmetric 90/10 layout. Content pushed to edges to create visual tension.
- **Risk Factor**: Vertical typography, 0px border radius (Sharp Geometry), extreme negative space.
- **Cliché Liquidation**:
  - NO Purple/Violet.
  - NO Centered Hero.
  - NO Standard Top Navigation.
  - NO Soft Rounded Corners.
- **Palette**: Noir (#0a0a0b), Slate (#64748b), Emerald (#10b981), Stark White (#ffffff).
